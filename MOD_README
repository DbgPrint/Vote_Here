Diplopia mafia posts are assumed to have the word "Diplopia" in the title.

Add the following markup to day posts:

    [](#players|...)[](#operators|...)
    
Where `...` represents:
    * `players`: a pipe-delimited list of novelty accounts currently playing in the game
    * `operators`: a pipe-delimited list of actual players (who control the novelties) in the game
