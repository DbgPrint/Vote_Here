Only day threads posted by /u/DiplopiaMafia will have Diplopia-style vote threads.

Add the following markup to day posts:

    [](#players|...)[](#operators|...)
    
Where `...` represents:
    * `players`: a pipe-delimited list of novelty accounts currently playing in the game
    * `operators`: a pipe-delimited list of actual players (who control the novelties) in the game
